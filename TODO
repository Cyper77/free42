Decimal version: SQRT(2) returns 1.414213562373095048801688, should be
1.414213562373095048801689. Compare the result from bc(1) with scale > 24.
(Amusing but probably irrelevant detail: bc with scale=24 returns the same
erroneous result as Free42 Decimal!)
Note: this bug existed even before the 25-digit patch (version 1.4.22).

Pressing any key during PSE should halt program execution and execute the
keystroke. This could be a bit tricky to implement because the current PSE
implementation simply freezes the UI for 1 second; proper keyboard handling
will require a whole new core state (similar to the GETKEY state).

SOLVE: detect more sign reversals (not just the ones where the sign reversal
brackets a domain error). This isn't strictly a bug, since it is mathematically
impossible to reliably tell poles from zeroes (the real HP-42S doesn't always
get it right either), but there is clearly some room for improvement.

GTK and Motif versions: /proc/acpi support for battery status checking.

PalmOS version: hardware keyboard mapping, using a keymap.txt file and skin-
specific mappings in the *.layout file, like the other Free42 versions.

Plain text program import/export; HP-41 ROM image import.

Import/export of variables.

Directories.

"Sticky" complex numbers, which remember the mode (polar or rectangular) they
were entered in, and are always displayed in that mode.

Algebraic equations, a la HP-27S.

Fractions.

Larger display; show more stack registers, program lines, etc., at once.

Allow more digits in the display (FIX >= 12, etc.; also, allow entry of more
than 12 digits when entering a number).
