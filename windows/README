I developed the Windows shell for Free42 using Visual C++, running under
Windows 98 SE, running under Win4Lin 3.0.
Because I was running Windows under Linux, I could use symlinks and keep all
the common files in the 'common' directory. If you want to use these sources on
a regular Windows installation, you should copy the files from 'common' to
'windows'; if you're using Win4Lin, you can use the 'make-symlinks' script to
create all the required links.

Note: the Free42 workspace contains three projects: Free42, keymap2c, and
skin2c. Before building Free42, you must build keymap2c and skin2c and run
them; this creates the keymap.c and skins.c files, which contain the default
keymap and the skins to be compiled into the Free42 executable.
