Decimal floating point.

Pocket PC version.

Windows version: in Win2k, computing the scrollbar width (print-out window)
does not work, because the code relies on a Win98 registry key that does not
exist in Win2k. Need to find a clean (read: "supported") way of finding the
desktop settings.
Users who have the scroll bar width set to 16 (the Windows default) won't
notice anything, but if you use "large fonts", there will be a few pixels
chopped off at the right edge of the print-out because of this bug.
