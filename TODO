Revisit SOLVE: compare its performance to the examples given in Chapter 3 of
the Programming Examples & Techniques book.

Revisit printing: am I handling line wrapping properly? What does the real
HP-42S do when printing a complex number that does not fit on one line?

Import/export of variables.

Plain-text program import/export.

PalmOS version: support dynamic screen size changes (dynamic input area;
portrait/landscape mode switching). The tricky bit: storing the currenly
selected skin will no longer be a simple matter of keeping track of one skin
name; I'll have to keep track of a list of name/resolution pairs.

Pocket PC version.

The requests for fractions, equations, and decimal floating point keep cropping
up; I'm not committing to those features but I decided to put them back in the
TODO list so that people are aware that I am aware of these requests. :-)

In DEG and GRAD modes, trig functions should check arguments for multiples of
90 degrees (100 grads) and possibly other special values that most users
expect to return exact results. Note that "trig functions" includes rect/polar
conversions and the COMPLEX function.

Requested "always on top feature".

Alan Arndt <aga@jlw.com>, 8/11/2005:
1) Typing rapidly on Windows drops keystrokes. I suspect that Free42's message
handling code is to blame; prime suspect is "rollover" (user presses X, user
presses Y, user releases X, user releases Y).
2) Skins should have sensitive rectangles that are as large as possible, to
maximize the area to hit with the mouse or pen; this reduces the need for
accurate pointing and thereby reduces stress on the user's arm. A pain to do,
because skin editing is so tedious, but it would be a good thing to help free
the world from RSI.

One thing I thought would be great for Free42 is the ability to load 41 modules
in .MOD or .ROM format; not the machine-code stuff that is irrelevant to
the 42 (CCD, Advantage, Hepax, AEC, PPC...), but the PURE RPN modules, such
as Financial, Securites, Aviation, etc. For ease of use, this would require
maybe to expand the 42 to support directories and associated commands (MKDIR,
RMDIR, UPDIR,...) which is also good to organize stuff in an already much
improved 42 with I/O and loads of memory...
Today if you want to load 41 modules programs, you need to go into a painful
process using a 41 emulator: for each program you want, copy it into the
main memory, export it in raw format, and load the .raw in Free42. Not really
effective when you have tons of programs in a module.

Joseph Helfand <jhelfand@limno.com>, 12/29/2005:
Complained about behavior of 0^0, which returns an error on the HP-42S, but
returns 1 on Free42. I consider Free42's behavior to be better, so I won't
change it. A configuration option is of course possible but I won't do that
either unless someone shows me that this is actually necessary.
Having said all that, the behavior of 0^0 in Free42 is inconsistent with the
behavior of (0+0i)^0 etc; the latter have to be fixed.

Vincent Weber <viweber@bluewin.ch>, 1/5/2006:
10 ENTER COMPLEX SIN SIN
yields
<Infinity> i<Infinity>
Clearly, some more range checks are needed in the complex trigs.
