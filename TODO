Take a look at the print-out generated by SUN (YMIN=-90, YMAX=90, AXIS=0,
XMIN=0, XMAX=360, XINC=30, TILT=23.5, LAT=52, SEAS=indep, TOD=12, HGHT=dep).
There are discontinuities, and that seems wrong. What's going on here?
(Seems like a bug in BCD20 -- the Binary version does not exhibit this
behavior.)

Make '\' act as R/S even in ALPHA mode. R/S is important, and the backslash is
not, in the HP-42S part of the universe, anyway.

Add information about keyboard mapping to README.txt files (all versions).
Don't necessarily go into detail about how to customize the mapping, but *do*
list all the default mappings.

PalmOS version: add explanation to README.txt about skins -- why they won't
work off an SD card, how to install them properly, yada yada yada.

Decimal version: SQRT(2) returns 1.414213562373095048801688, should be
1.414213562373095048801689. Apparently, BCDFloat::sqrt() simply stops after
computing P digits of the result, rather than computing one extra and then
rounding (only needed if the most significant base-10000 digit of the result is
between 1 and 9, of course).
I haven't investigated yet if it is possible to fix this by simply going
through the digit loop one extra time -- it is possible that this will cause
problems if the precision in the temporaries is exhausted.
I should probably bring this to Hugh Steers' attention; if it can't be fixed
easily, then possible solutions will probably involve using the new
higher-precision BCDDouble type for temporaries; this also opens up the
possibility of using Newton's method, which might be faster than the 'long
division' algorithm.

Pressing any key during PSE should halt program execution and execute the
keystroke. This could be a bit tricky to implement because the current PSE
implementation simply freezes the UI for 1 second; proper keyboard handling
will require a whole new core state (similar to the GETKEY state).

On the real HP-42S and Emu42, when running a program using XEQ and picking it
from the program catalog, the menu stays up while the program runs (or rather,
the display is not repainted). In Free42, the display is repainted before
program execution begins. Purely cosmetic perhaps, but still a bug.

SOLVE: detect more sign reversals (not just the ones where the sign reversal
brackets a domain error). This isn't strictly a bug, since it is mathematically
impossible to reliably tell poles from zeroes (the real HP-42S doesn't always
get it right either), but there is clearly some room for improvement.

GTK and Motif versions: /proc/acpi support for battery status checking.

PalmOS version: hardware keyboard mapping, using a keymap.txt file and skin-
specific mappings in the *.layout file, like the other Free42 versions.

Plain text program import/export; HP-41 ROM image import.
