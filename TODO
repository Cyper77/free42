Allow larger matrices on the Palm. The easiest way to implement this seems to
be to define my own malloc() and realloc(), which use MemGluePtrNew() and
MemPtrResize() under the hood (with realloc() falling back on MemGluePtrNew()
plus MemPtrFree() in case the MemPtrResize() call fails, which it often will,
since MemPtrResize() does not try very hard).

Plain text program import/export; HP-41 ROM image import.

Import/export of variables.

Directories.

"Sticky" complex numbers, which remember the mode (polar or rectangular) they
were entered in, and are always displayed in that mode.

Algebraic equations, a la HP-27S.

Fractions.

Larger display; show more stack registers, program lines, etc., at once.

Allow more digits in the display (FIX >= 12, etc.; also, allow entry of more
than 12 digits when entering a number).
