Android version:
* The key click is flaky on some devices. Why?
* Add android:installLocation property to the manifest, to support installing
  the app on external memory (SD card) under Android 2.2 or later. See
  http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/install-location.html
* Support arbitrary skin scaling and positioning.
* ACCEL, LOCAT, and HEADING don't work on a lot of devices. I'll have to
  rewrite them using the new APIs (ugh).
* Add support for physical keyboards.
* Implement pop-up keyboard for ALPHA mode text entry.
* Scale print-out (the current 2:1 scaling is a bit small on large screens)

iPhone version:
* Add option to disable key click.
* Haptic feedback option.
* The pop-up keyboard handling in the Preferences and File Selection views is
  broken. The screen often doesn't scroll up when the keyboard appears. That
  should be fixed, and while you're at it, put those views inside scroll views,
  so you can scroll them when the keyboard is visible.
* Implement pop-up keyboard for ALPHA mode text entry.
* Implement copy & paste.
* Implement URL decoding for HTTP requests (filenames with spaces, etc.)
* Support iPad, iPad mini, and iPhone 5 (screen size issues, and take advantage
  of big screens to show the calculator and print-out side-by-side).
* Support arbitrary skin scaling and positioning.

Windows version:
* The "Calculator Key" option should probably set
  \HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\AppKey\18\ShellExecute,
  not \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\AppKey\18\ShellExecute.
  Easy enough to fix, but make sure that the new code restores the
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE key so that people won't have to use regedit to get rid of
  the old Free42 mapping!
* Another "Calculator Key" issue: it doesn't seem to work in multi-language
  installs. Some other registry key overriding the obvious one, it seems. But
  maybe that'll be fixed by dealing with the issue above.

Mac version:
* Modify the file selection dialogs so they have a file type menu, and add
  extensions to file names automagically when appropriate.

All versions:
* Add a feature for importing and exporting variables from and to CSV files.
* It would be nice if we would handle the shell_milliseconds() wrap-around.
  This function is only used for flying the goose and updating the progress
  report when the solver is running interactively; all it would take is for
  those two places in the code to detect unlikely values of
  (startTime - shell_milliseconds()) and assume the nearest likely alternative,
  a la Y2K.

The "Wouldn't It Be Nice" Department:
* Algebraic equations.
* Units, like on the HP-48G, where units are attached to values.
