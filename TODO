PalmOS/ARM: PalmOS compatibility test should be modified -- check PalmOS 5.0,
	    not 3.0, and check ARM cpu (disable the latter check if DEBUG).
PalmOS/ARM: ARM/68K state file compatibility
PalmOS/ARM: shell_wants_cpu() currently incurs the overhead of an ARM-to-68K
            call, PLUS the EventAvail() trap. How about invoking the trap
	    directly from the ARM code -- since shell_wants_cpu() is a major
	    performance bottleneck, this might help.
Clean up palmos source -- would be nice to move all the mathlib* stuff to a
separate directory; also fully integrate Peal into the source repository (so
building does not depend on having it already installed somewhere).

Plain text program import/export; HP-41 ROM image import.

Import/export of variables.

"Sticky" complex numbers, which remember the mode (polar or rectangular) they
were entered in, and are always displayed in that mode.

Algebraic equations, a la HP-27S.

Fractions.
