I have several contributed programs that still need to be put up on my web
site: an Advanced Encryption Standard implementation by Brett Stevens, a
surveying program by Tony Nikkel, and some interesting Free42 patches for the
Palm and Mac by Jeff Dionne.

When the BASE->A..F menu is active, the PC keyboard's A thru F keys should act
as number entry keys, overriding any mappings from the keyboard map. (Compare
the behavior of the PC keyboard in ALPHA mode.)

Revisit printing: am I handling line wrapping properly? What does the real
HP-42S do when printing a complex number that does not fit on one line?

Import/export of variables.

Plain-text program import/export.

PalmOS version: support dynamic screen size changes (dynamic input area;
portrait/landscape mode switching). The tricky bit: storing the currenly
selected skin will no longer be a simple matter of keeping track of one skin
name; I'll have to keep track of a list of name/resolution pairs.

PalmOS version: repainting the display, when using high-resolution skins on
the Tungsten E, is slow. I should profile this; is my code for constructing
high-resolution bitmaps inefficient, or am I using the wrong PalmOS calls, or
is PalmOS itself to blame?

Pocket PC version.

The requests for fractions, equations, and decimal floating point keep cropping
up; I'm not committing to those features but I decided to put them back in the
TODO list so that people are aware that I am aware of these requests. :-)

1) Typing rapidly on Windows drops keystrokes. I suspect that Free42's message
handling code is to blame; prime suspect is "rollover" (user presses X, user
presses Y, user releases X, user releases Y).
Update: I've noticed the same phenomenon when using the Linux version, so maybe
this is a problem in the emulator core? Or is the X11 shell buggy too?
Interesting, because keyboard handling is very different between the Windows
and X11 shells.
2) Skins should have sensitive rectangles that are as large as possible, to
maximize the area to hit with the mouse or pen; this reduces the need for
accurate pointing and thereby reduces stress on the user's arm. A pain to do,
because skin editing is so tedious, but it would be a good thing to help free
the world from RSI.

Vincent Weber (viweber at bluewin dot ch), 12/21/2005:
One thing I thought would be great for Free42 is the ability to load 41 modules
in .MOD or .ROM format; not the machine-code stuff that is irrelevant to
the 42 (CCD, Advantage, Hepax, AEC, PPC...), but the PURE RPN modules, such
as Financial, Securites, Aviation, etc. For ease of use, this would require
maybe to expand the 42 to support directories and associated commands (MKDIR,
RMDIR, UPDIR,...) which is also good to organize stuff in an already much
improved 42 with I/O and loads of memory...
Today if you want to load 41 modules programs, you need to go into a painful
process using a 41 emulator: for each program you want, copy it into the
main memory, export it in raw format, and load the .raw in Free42. Not really
effective when you have tons of programs in a module.
