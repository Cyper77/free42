Keyboard mapping.
Printer emulation & spooling.

For the built-in skins and keymap, just include the actual files in the bundle,
and forget about the skins2cc and keymap2cc awkwardness. The only thing that
would have to be customized is the code that figures out which skins are
available in the bundle; this could simply be a text file, also in the bundle,
or, if there is an API that supports this reasonably conveniently, we could
simply enumerate the *.layout files at the bundle's top level.
