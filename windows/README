Before running "make" in this directory, you need to run "copy-files", in order
to get the files from the "common" directory. Before committing, run
"copy-back" to copy the files back to "common". This hassle is necessary
because the MinGW C++ compiler does not appear to recognize Cygwin-type
symlinks.
(Of course, when running Cygwin under Win4Lin, you can use real symlinks.)
