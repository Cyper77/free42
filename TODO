Code review to look for unchecked allocations. Note that the old strategy of
assuming new_real() is safe following a free_vartype() is no longer sound: for
one thing, with the introduction of BCD, vartype_real is no longer the smallest
type; for another, with the introduction of instance pooling, free_vartype()
may not free up any memory at all!

Code review to check that run-mode XEQ, *and* *any* run-mode instruction that
alters the PC, all clear the RTN stack.

Revisit STO arithmetic. What does the HP-42S do when matrix-matrix STOx causes
the dimensions of the indexed matrix to change? How about STOx that does not
cause such a change? Etc.

Find out what the "Spectral Test" is (Knuth, Seminumerical Algorithms, vol. 2),
and check if the Free42 RAN function passes it (binary *and* decimal).

Pressing any key during PSE should halt program execution and execute the
keystroke.

In HEXM and OCTM modes, SHOW should show the *decimal* form of the number in X.

Compared to the HP-42S, the Free42 implementation of SOLVE does not do a very
good job of identifying sign reversals. It converges on the correct value, but
it does not check explicitly for wild behavior around the zero crossing. I
wonder how the 42S does this? Simply looking at the difference between f(x1)
and f(x2) won't do, because you don't know whether that difference is "large"
or not, without prior knowledge of the expected scale of the result. Hmmm...

GTK and Motif versions: /proc/acpi support for battery status checking.

PalmOS version: hardware keyboard mapping, using a keymap.txt file and skin-
specific mappings in the *.layout file, like the other Free42 versions.

Plain text program import/export; HP-41 ROM image import.

Import/export of variables.

Directories.

"Sticky" complex numbers, which remember the mode (polar or rectangular) they
were entered in, and are always displayed in that mode.

Algebraic equations, a la HP-27S.

Fractions.

Larger display; show more stack registers, program lines, etc., at once.

Allow more digits in the display (FIX >= 12, etc.; also, allow entry of more
than 12 digits when entering a number).
