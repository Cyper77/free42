PalmOS/ARM: Use peal's -K option to strip unneeded symbols
PalmOS/ARM: PalmOS compatibility test should be modified -- check PalmOS 5.0,
	    not 3.0, and check ARM cpu (disable the latter check if DEBUG).
PalmOS/ARM: "Loading" message box (3 seconds with no feedback is TOO LONG!)
PalmOS/ARM: ARM/68K state file compatibility
PalmOS/ARM: shell_wants_cpu() currently incurs the overhead of an ARM-to-68K
            call, PLUS the EventAvail() trap. How about invoking the trap
	    directly from the ARM code -- since shell_wants_cpu() is a major
	    performance bottleneck, this might help.
