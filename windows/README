I developed the Windows shell for Free42 using Visual C++, running under
Windows 98 SE, running under Win4Lin 3.0.
Because I run Windows under Linux, I can use symlinks and keep all the common
files in the 'common' directory. If you want to use these sources on a regular
Windows installation, you should copy the files from 'common' to 'windows'
using the copy-files script; if you're using Win4Lin, you can use the
'make-symlinks' script to create all the required links.

Note: the Free42 workspace contains four projects: Free42Binary, Free42Decimal,
keymap2cpp, and skin2cpp. Before building Free42Binary and Free42Decimal, you
must build keymap2cpp and skin2cpp and run them; this creates the keymap.cpp
and skins.cpp files, which contain the default keymap and the skins to be
compiled into the Free42 executable.

Update: as an alternative, you can also build the Windows version using MinGW
now. Run copy-files or make-symlinks to get the stuff from the 'common'
directory; then say 'make' to build the binary version, or 'make -e BCD_MATH=1'
to build the decimal version. Note that the /mingw/bin directory must be ahead
of /usr/bin in PATH in order to run the MinGW versions of g++ etc. instead of
the usual Cygwin versions.
To build debug versions, add "-e CFG=Debug" to the make command.
