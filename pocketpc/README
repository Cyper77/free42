To build Free42 for PocketPC, first open a Cygwin bash shell and run
'copy-files'; this will copy the required files from the 'common' directory to
the 'pocketpc' directory. Next, run 'make'; this compiles and runs the skin2cpp
program, which generates the skins.cpp file, containing the skins to be
compiled into the executable.

Once these preparations are done, you can run eMbedded Visual C++. Open the
Free42.vcw workspace. This workspace contains two projects: Free42Binary and
Free42Decimal; these build the Binary and Decimal versions of Free42,
respectively.
