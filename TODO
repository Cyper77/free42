Windows version: when printing with the print-out window closed, it looks like
the scroll-back buffer won't grow to its maximum size. Also, why is the max
size currently 16384 and not 32767?
(The Pocket PC version has the same problem -- not a big surprise, I guess, as
both the OS and the Free42 printing code are mostly identical. Also, the Motif
ande PalmOS versions do not have this problem.)
