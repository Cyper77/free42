I developed the Windows shell for Free42 using Visual C++, running under
Windows 98 SE, running under Win4Lin 3.0.
Because I run Windows under Linux, I can use symlinks and keep all the common
files in the 'common' directory. If you want to use these sources on a regular
Windows installation, you should copy the files from 'common' to 'windows'
using the copy-files script; if you're using Win4Lin, you can use the
'make-symlinks' script to create all the required links.

Note: the Free42 workspace contains three projects: Free42, keymap2cpp, and
skin2cpp. Before building Free42, you must build keymap2cpp and skin2cpp and
run them; this creates the keymap.cpp and skins.cpp files, which contain the
default keymap and the skins to be compiled into the Free42 executable.
