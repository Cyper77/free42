BCD20 library: in the BCDFloat class, modify the const char * constructor, the
double constructor, and the add, sub, mul, div, and sqrt methods, so that they
round their final result to exactly 25 decimal digits.
This is necessary because with pure base-10000, as used now, the ratio of the
worst-case to best-case relative representation errors is 10000, which can
wreak havoc on the convergence tests of some numerical iterative algorithms.
Generally speaking, it is unwise to compute a 28-digit result when you know
that some of your intermediaries may have been rounded to only 25 digits; the
extra digits basically introduce noise, which can lead to the aforementioned
convergence problems.

GTK and Motif versions: /proc/acpi support for battery status checking.

PalmOS version: hardware keyboard mapping, using a keymap.txt file and skin-
specific mappings in the *.layout file, like the other Free42 versions.

Plain text program import/export; HP-41 ROM image import.

Import/export of variables.

Directories.

"Sticky" complex numbers, which remember the mode (polar or rectangular) they
were entered in, and are always displayed in that mode.

Algebraic equations, a la HP-27S.

Fractions.

Larger display; show more stack registers, program lines, etc., at once.

Allow more digits in the display (FIX >= 12, etc.; also, allow entry of more
than 12 digits when entering a number).
