Motif (free42bin.exe, Cygwin) crashes while saving RT. (Cygwin bug? The
GTK version does not crash...)

When I SOLVE the function LBL "CC" MVAR "X" RCL "X" RCL "X" X^2 - / 1 -
the sign reversal is not flagged, but it also returns X and Xprev that are
equal to each other -- that seems wrong.

Pressing any key during PSE should halt program execution and execute the
keystroke.

GTK and Motif versions: /proc/acpi support for battery status checking.

SOLVE: detect more sign reversals (not just the ones where the sign reversal
brackets a domain error).

PalmOS version: hardware keyboard mapping, using a keymap.txt file and skin-
specific mappings in the *.layout file, like the other Free42 versions.

Plain text program import/export; HP-41 ROM image import.

Import/export of variables.

Directories.

"Sticky" complex numbers, which remember the mode (polar or rectangular) they
were entered in, and are always displayed in that mode.

Algebraic equations, a la HP-27S.

Fractions.

Larger display; show more stack registers, program lines, etc., at once.

Allow more digits in the display (FIX >= 12, etc.; also, allow entry of more
than 12 digits when entering a number).
