It would be nice if we would handle the shell_milliseconds()
wrap-around. This function is only used for flying the goose and
updating the progress report when the solver is running interactively;
all it would take is for those two places in the code to detect
unlikely values of (startTime - shell_milliseconds()) and assume the nearest
likely alternative, a la Y2K.

Use an UncaughtExceptionHandler so the weirdness doesn't disappear into the
bit bucket.

The INVRT fix seems to have the undesirable side effect of delaying the
appearance of the "running" annunciator.
