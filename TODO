Pocket PC version.

PalmOS version: repainting the display, when using high-resolution skins on
the Tungsten E, is slow. I should profile this; is my code for constructing
high-resolution bitmaps inefficient, or am I using the wrong PalmOS calls, or
is PalmOS itself to blame?

PalmOS version: support dynamic screen size changes (dynamic input area;
portrait/landscape mode switching). The tricky bit: storing the currenly
selected skin will no longer be a simple matter of keeping track of one skin
name; I'll have to keep track of a list of name/resolution pairs, and the skin
size (in pixels) has to be added to the skin resource format -- and the Skin
menu has to be dynamically updated so it only shows skins that are usable at
the current screen size.

HP-41 module support. Should be able to read ROM files, and maybe also MOD;
should extract user code and warn if it encounters mcode. It would be nice to
group module programs in directories, to prevent the PGM catalog from becoming
hopelessly cluttered. (Arguably Free42 needs directories anyway, what with it
having basically limitless memory...)
(Requested by Vincent Weber, 12/21/2005)
Additional thoughts by ThO:
This is not an easy feature to implement, and adding directories is going to be
a real nightmare. As a temporary fix, to at least take most of the pain out of
transferring modules to Free42, I could write a separate MOD-to-raw conversion
program. This converter should extract user code, warn if it finds mcode, warn
if the user code calls the mcode, and convert all XROMs that call user code
from the same module (and warn about XROMs that call other modules, but not
about XROMs that Free42 recognizes, like XROM 29,20 (PRX), XROM 24,49 (AIP),
etc.).

Auto-repeat: for keys where the usual holding-down behavior isn't needed
(number keys, backspace, etc.) it might be nice to support auto-repeat.

The requests for fractions, equations, and decimal floating point keep cropping
up; I'm not committing to those features but I decided to put them back in the
TODO list so that people are aware that I am aware of these requests. :-)

GTK version.

Alternative forms of complex number entry and display: in addition to the
COMPLEX command, there should be ways to enter complex numbers in rectangular
or polar format *regardless* of the setting of flag 73. When numbers are
entered using those new commands (let's call them R.CPX and P.CPX for the sake
of discussion), the rect/polar display mode should "stick" to them, so they
will keep being displayed the same way even if flag 73 is toggled. Three
additional commands are needed to change a number's sticky mode (or maybe just
two; a number can always be forced back to "classic" behavior by doing COMPLEX
COMPLEX).
(Requested by Jeff O., 1/28/2005)
Additional thoughts by ThO:
Note that the "sticky" display mode could potentially break existing programs,
so it should be optional. Also, it is a LOT of work to implement, because the
complex data type has to be changed, and all the code that handles complex
numbers -- that's hundreds of code changes throughout the emulator core.
As an alternative, consider a partial implementation, where we add only the
R.CPX and P.CPX commands (plus possibly SHOW POLAR and SHOW RECT commands so
the user can view numbers in the format of their choice without having to
switch modes). Note: after entering a number, it should be displayed in the
format the user entered it in, for a second or two, before reverting to the
format specified by flag 73 -- in other words, when using R.CPX in POLAR mode,
or P.CPX in RECT mode, automatically do a SHOW RECT or SHOW POLAR as well.
