The decimal version does not properly sign-extend negative numbers in BASE
mode. In fact, everything seems kinda screwed up in BASE mode (but the binary
version is still OK). Could this have something to do with the item below?

Phloat::Phloat(int8) constructor uses double2bcd() internally. That is not good
-- can lose precision. Should add an int8_to_bcd() method. There are a few other
places where double2bcd() is also used inappropriately.

LN(POS_HUGE_DOUBLE iPOS_HUGE_DOUBLE) returns something involving <Infinity>

Patch BCD code to tolerate any number of leading zeroes on the exponent.

Does the BCD code leak memory? I couldn't help noticing that some of the
operators defined in the BCD class return dynamically allocated references.
Must ask Hugh -- it *seems* like a no-no to me.

The Binary Windows build, when built with MinGW, has an interesting SOLVE bug:
It does not converge on "SUN" with TILT=23.5, LAT=52, SEAS=3.75, HGHT=0,
SOLVE("TOD") (start TOD with 0 and 12). Noticed while running the PLOT test
case with YMIN=0, YMAX=12, AXIS=-1, XMIN=0, XMAX=360, XINC=30, indep=SEAS,
solve for TOD.
Note that the values do seem to converge on something; either the stopping
criteria are failing or there is some numerical weirdness going on.
It would be nice to get this straightened out -- not just on general principle,
but also because the MinGW build seems to perform a lot better, and then there
is the fact that g++ handles infinities and NaNs correctly, unlike VC++.

Decimal version: implement gamma(), and add *proper* implementations of log1p()
and expm1().

In the PalmOS Decimal build, and add code to delete the Free42BcdConv database.
How hard is it to get rid of the MathLib dependency? (What happens when
compiling without MathLib.h?)
Add new BCD_SECT section and put all non-inline code from bcd, bcdfloat, and
bcdmath into it.
The PalmOS Decimal build will require 'int' to be changed to 'Int32' in the bcd
code.

On binary/decimal switch, don't allow program to run at startup (override flag
11). The alternative is to go all the way, and update the pc and the whole
return stack; that would be nice, but it's annoying to implement.

Pocket PC version.

PalmOS version: support dynamic screen size changes (dynamic input area;
portrait/landscape mode switching). The tricky bit: storing the currenly
selected skin will no longer be a simple matter of keeping track of one skin
name; I'll have to keep track of a list of name/resolution pairs, and the skin
size (in pixels) has to be added to the skin resource format -- and the Skin
menu has to be dynamically updated so it only shows skins that are usable at
the current screen size.

PalmOS version: repainting the display, when using high-resolution skins on
the Tungsten E, is slow. I should profile this; is my code for constructing
high-resolution bitmaps inefficient, or am I using the wrong PalmOS calls, or
is PalmOS itself to blame?

Auto-repeat: for keys where the usual holding-down behavior isn't needed
(number keys, backspace, etc.) it might be nice to support auto-repeat.

HP-41 module support. Should be able to read ROM files, and maybe also MOD.
(Requested by Vincent Weber, 12/21/2005)
Additional thoughts by ThO:
The basic functionality of extracting user code from module ROM images is
already provided by the rom2raw program, but of course it would be nice to
integrate this into Free42 itself. However, in order to prevent the PGM catalog
from getting hopelessly cluttered, Free42 really should support directories.
If HP could add directories to the 28C to support the extra memory of the 28S,
surely I can do the same here -- and Free42 needs it even more than the 28S...

Algebraic equations, a la HP-27S.

Alternative forms of complex number entry and display: in addition to the
COMPLEX command, there should be ways to enter complex numbers in rectangular
or polar format *regardless* of the setting of flag 73. When numbers are
entered using those new commands (let's call them R.CPX and P.CPX for the sake
of discussion), the rect/polar display mode should "stick" to them, so they
will keep being displayed the same way even if flag 73 is toggled. Three
additional commands are needed to change a number's sticky mode (or maybe just
two; a number can always be forced back to "classic" behavior by doing COMPLEX
COMPLEX).
(Requested by Jeff O., 1/28/2005)
Additional thoughts by ThO:
Note that the "sticky" display mode could potentially break existing programs,
so it should be optional. Also, it is a LOT of work to implement, because the
complex data type has to be changed, and all the code that handles complex
numbers -- that's hundreds of code changes throughout the emulator core.
As an alternative, consider a partial implementation, where we add only the
R.CPX and P.CPX commands (plus possibly SHOW POLAR and SHOW RECT commands so
the user can view numbers in the format of their choice without having to
switch modes). Note: after entering a number, it should be displayed in the
format the user entered it in, for a second or two, before reverting to the
format specified by flag 73 -- in other words, when using R.CPX in POLAR mode,
or P.CPX in RECT mode, automatically do a SHOW RECT or SHOW POLAR as well.
