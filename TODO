The GTK version initially shows the print-out window scrolled to the top.
Apparently, the show_printout_to_bottom() call in main() isn't having the
desired effect -- it probably needs to be deferred until *after* the window
is realized or mapped or whatever.

More GTK print-out window misery: when the window is not positioned at the
bottom, and print-out occurs, it can get painted wrong; the bottom line is
displayed twice. Apparently, the scrolling and painting is not taking place in
the sequence I expected.

The "Paste" command converts numbers from text to 'double' before passing them
to the emulator core; for the Decimal version, this can lead to inexact values
being pasted. The conversion should be direct from text to decimal in this
case; the clean implementation would be to push *all* paste handling into the
emulator core.

Pocket PC version.

PalmOS version: support dynamic screen size changes (dynamic input area;
portrait/landscape mode switching). The tricky bit: storing the currenly
selected skin will no longer be a simple matter of keeping track of one skin
name; I'll have to keep track of a list of name/resolution pairs, and the skin
size (in pixels) has to be added to the skin resource format -- and the Skin
menu has to be dynamically updated so it only shows skins that are usable at
the current screen size.

PalmOS version: repainting the display, when using high-resolution skins on
the Tungsten E, is slow. I should profile this; is my code for constructing
high-resolution bitmaps inefficient, or am I using the wrong PalmOS calls, or
is PalmOS itself to blame?

Auto-repeat: for keys where the usual holding-down behavior isn't needed
(number keys, backspace, etc.) it might be nice to support auto-repeat.

HP-41 module support. Should be able to read ROM files, and maybe also MOD.
(Requested by Vincent Weber, 12/21/2005)
Additional thoughts by ThO:
The basic functionality of extracting user code from module ROM images is
already provided by the rom2raw program, but of course it would be nice to
integrate this into Free42 itself. However, in order to prevent the PGM catalog
from getting hopelessly cluttered, Free42 really should support directories.
If HP could add directories to the 28C to support the extra memory of the 28S,
surely I can do the same here -- and Free42 needs it even more than the 28S...

Alternative forms of complex number entry and display: in addition to the
COMPLEX command, there should be ways to enter complex numbers in rectangular
or polar format *regardless* of the setting of flag 73. When numbers are
entered using those new commands (let's call them R.CPX and P.CPX for the sake
of discussion), the rect/polar display mode should "stick" to them, so they
will keep being displayed the same way even if flag 73 is toggled. Three
additional commands are needed to change a number's sticky mode (or maybe just
two; a number can always be forced back to "classic" behavior by doing COMPLEX
COMPLEX).
(Requested by Jeff O., 1/28/2005)
Additional thoughts by ThO:
Note that the "sticky" display mode could potentially break existing programs,
so it should be optional. Also, it is a LOT of work to implement, because the
complex data type has to be changed, and all the code that handles complex
numbers -- that's hundreds of code changes throughout the emulator core.
As an alternative, consider a partial implementation, where we add only the
R.CPX and P.CPX commands (plus possibly SHOW POLAR and SHOW RECT commands so
the user can view numbers in the format of their choice without having to
switch modes). Note: after entering a number, it should be displayed in the
format the user entered it in, for a second or two, before reverting to the
format specified by flag 73 -- in other words, when using R.CPX in POLAR mode,
or P.CPX in RECT mode, automatically do a SHOW RECT or SHOW POLAR as well.
