ARM-native PalmOS version.

Auto-repeat: for keys where the usual holding-down behavior isn't needed
(number keys and backspace) it would be nice to support auto-repeat. This could
probably be implemented using the same mechanism that's already used for the
"up" and "down" keys.

PocketPC version: a few people suggested hiding the task bar to make some more
room available for taller skins. Apparently, Emu48 and some other applications
also do this. Will need to do a little research there (do I simply use another
window style? Without a task bar, how do you close the window or switch apps?).
