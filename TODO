Make the orange labels on the PocketPC "Standard" skin larger. The buttons can
easily be made 2 pixels shorter, which creates room to make the orange labels 2
pixels taller -- like they are on the Windows/Unix "Standard" skin.

ARM-native PalmOS version.

PocketPC version: a few people suggested hiding the "top" bar to make some more
room available for taller skins. Apparently, Emu48 and some other applications
do this. Will need to do a little research there (do I simply use another
window style? Without a topbar, how do you close the window or switch apps?).

"Sloppy clicking": optional setting to map mouse clicks that do NOT hit any of
the sensitive rectangles, to whichever key is nearest. This would be more
elegant than stretching sensitive rectangles in skin layouts, which some people
don't seem to like anyway.

Auto-repeat: for keys where the usual holding-down behavior isn't needed
(number keys, backspace, etc.) it might be nice to support auto-repeat.

Extended program import/export. Import and export should allow the user to
specify *.txt as the file type, for reading and writing plain-text program
listings. (Probably need at least two sub-options: raw text, and text with
Free42-style character remapping.) Also, for Import, it would be nice to accept
*.ROM (and possibly also *.MOD) files (HP-41 module images); this should use
the user code extraction functionality from rom2raw.

Import/export of variables.

"Sticky" complex numbers, which remember the mode (polar or rectangular) they
were entered in, and are always displayed in that mode; also needs R.CPX and
P.CPX commands to allow entering a complex number in rectangular or polar
format regardless of the current setting of flag 73.

Algebraic equations, a la HP-27S.

Fractions.
