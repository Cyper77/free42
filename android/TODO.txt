Call endCoreThread() on entry to any event handler: onTouch, onDraw, etc.,
and any timer callback.
Note the value of coreWantsCpu.
On exit of the event handler, restart the core thread if necessary.
Doing it this way, you can be sure that the core thread is never running while
you're executing your event handling code -- which is exactly how the
core/shell interface was designed to work.

To keep programs running, make sure to handle the returns from these
functions:
(or check if these functions' returns are relevant to begin with)

core_keydown()
core_timeout3()
core_keyup()
core_allows_powerdown() -- the want_cpu parameter
core_powercycle()
