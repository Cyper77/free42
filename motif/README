About Free42

Free42 is a free re-implementation of the HP-42S scientific programmable RPN
calculator, which was made from 1988 until 1995 by Hewlett-Packard.
Free42 is a complete rewrite and contains no HP code whatsoever.
At this time, the author supports versions that run on PalmOS, Microsoft
Windows, and Linux.


Installing Free42:

Copy free42 to wherever you want it, e.g. $HOME/bin or /usr/local/bin, and make
sure that that directory is in your PATH environment variable.
When Free42 runs, it will create a directory named .free42 in your home
directory; in this directory, it will create three files, 'state', 'print', and
'keymap' (the calculator's internal state, the contents of the print-out
window, and the PC keyboard map); also, if you want to use a non-standard skin
with Free42, the .free42 directory is where you have to store the skin's layout
and bitmap files.


Uninstalling Free42:

Remove free42 and the $HOME/.free42 directory and its contents.


NOTE: The binary in this package was built on a PC running Red Hat Linux
version 7.3, and it is dynamically linked against glibc version 2.2.5 and
Open Motif version 2.2.2. If your system has different versions of these
libraries, the binary in this package may not work. In this case, please
download the Free42 source package and try to compile Free42 using your
installation's own compiler and libraries.
In the future, the author plans to provide binaries for more recent versions of
Linux, but at present, he's worried that if he tries to upgrade his development
system, everything will come crashing down around him. Stay tuned...
