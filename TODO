The PalmOS version, when running on the Zire 21, does not seem to return Inf
and NaN results when it should (e.g. 10+10i SIN SIN). Works fine on PalmSim,
though. What's going on? ... This *is* reproducible under POSE.
First guess: some weirdness with globals again... POS_HUGE_DOUBLE etc. not
mapped properly?

The Decimal version, Unix and Windows, in FIX and SCI modes, displays 0 as
0.00E-4. Why? Also, number entry is screwed up: I can't enter 0.0000001 on
the BCD version.

When windows/Free42.exe is built without BCD_MATH, the solver no longer
converges on "SUN" with TILT=23.5, LAT=52, SEAS=3.75, HGHT=0, SOLVE("TOD")
(start TOD with 0 and 12). Noticed while running the PLOT test case with
YMIN=0, YMAX=12, AXIS=-1, XMIN=0, XMAX=360, XINC=30, indep=SEAS, solve for TOD.
The BCD_MATH build works fine on this test case, as do all the Unix/Cygwin
builds.
Note that the values do seem to converge on something; either the stopping
criteria are failing or there is some numerical weirdness going on.

Regression test HMS+, HMS-, ->HMS, ->HR, ISG, DSE, ->DEC, ->OCT, AIP,
DIM, NEWMAT, GETM, R<>R, string<->number conversion.

In the PalmOS Decimal build, and add code to delete the Free42BcdConv database.
How hard is it to get rid of the MathLib dependency? (What happens when
compiling without MathLib.h?)
Add new BCD_SECT section and put all non-inline code from bcd, bcdfloat, and
bcdmath into it.

Regression testing: the binary version seems to execute prm_bin OK, and the
solver and plot_thomas also look fine. On the decimal version, however,
prm_dec and pi_dec do not work correctly. And, I got a crash a while back,
weirdness with XEQ using the PGM catalog yielding "Invalid Type"... Sounds
like memory corruption.

Decimal version: implement gamma(), and add *proper* implementations of log1p()
and expm1().

Pass BCDFloat patches on to Hugh Steers.

Pocket PC version.

PalmOS version: support dynamic screen size changes (dynamic input area;
portrait/landscape mode switching). The tricky bit: storing the currenly
selected skin will no longer be a simple matter of keeping track of one skin
name; I'll have to keep track of a list of name/resolution pairs, and the skin
size (in pixels) has to be added to the skin resource format -- and the Skin
menu has to be dynamically updated so it only shows skins that are usable at
the current screen size.

PalmOS version: repainting the display, when using high-resolution skins on
the Tungsten E, is slow. I should profile this; is my code for constructing
high-resolution bitmaps inefficient, or am I using the wrong PalmOS calls, or
is PalmOS itself to blame?

HP-41 module support. Should be able to read ROM files, and maybe also MOD.
(Requested by Vincent Weber, 12/21/2005)
Additional thoughts by ThO:
The basic functionality of extracting user code from module ROM images is
already provided by the rom2raw program, but of course it would be nice to
integrate this into Free42 itself. However, in order to prevent the PGM catalog
from getting hopelessly cluttered, Free42 really should support directories.
If HP could add directories to the 28C to support the extra memory of the 28S,
surely I can do the same here -- and Free42 needs it even more than the 28S...

Auto-repeat: for keys where the usual holding-down behavior isn't needed
(number keys, backspace, etc.) it might be nice to support auto-repeat.

The requests for fractions, equations, and decimal floating point keep cropping
up; I'm not committing to those features but I decided to put them back in the
TODO list so that people are aware that I am aware of these requests. :-)

GTK version.

Plain-text program import/export.

Import/export of variables.

Alternative forms of complex number entry and display: in addition to the
COMPLEX command, there should be ways to enter complex numbers in rectangular
or polar format *regardless* of the setting of flag 73. When numbers are
entered using those new commands (let's call them R.CPX and P.CPX for the sake
of discussion), the rect/polar display mode should "stick" to them, so they
will keep being displayed the same way even if flag 73 is toggled. Three
additional commands are needed to change a number's sticky mode (or maybe just
two; a number can always be forced back to "classic" behavior by doing COMPLEX
COMPLEX).
(Requested by Jeff O., 1/28/2005)
Additional thoughts by ThO:
Note that the "sticky" display mode could potentially break existing programs,
so it should be optional. Also, it is a LOT of work to implement, because the
complex data type has to be changed, and all the code that handles complex
numbers -- that's hundreds of code changes throughout the emulator core.
As an alternative, consider a partial implementation, where we add only the
R.CPX and P.CPX commands (plus possibly SHOW POLAR and SHOW RECT commands so
the user can view numbers in the format of their choice without having to
switch modes). Note: after entering a number, it should be displayed in the
format the user entered it in, for a second or two, before reverting to the
format specified by flag 73 -- in other words, when using R.CPX in POLAR mode,
or P.CPX in RECT mode, automatically do a SHOW RECT or SHOW POLAR as well.
