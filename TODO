PocketPC version: a few people suggested hiding the task bar to make some more
room available for taller skins. Apparently, Emu48 and some other applications
also do this. Will need to do a little research there (do I simply use another
window style? Without a task bar, how do you close the window or switch apps?).

ARM-native PalmOS version.

Plain text import/export; HP-41 ROM image import.

Import/export of variables.

"Sticky" complex numbers, which remember the mode (polar or rectangular) they
were entered in, and are always displayed in that mode.
