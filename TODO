Import/export of variables.

Plain-text program import/export.

Pocket PC version.

PalmOS version: repainting the display, when using high-resolution skins on
the Tungsten E, is slow. I should profile this; is my code for constructing
high-resolution bitmaps inefficient, or am I using the wrong PalmOS calls, or
is PalmOS itself to blame?

PalmOS version: support dynamic screen size changes (dynamic input area;
portrait/landscape mode switching). The tricky bit: storing the currenly
selected skin will no longer be a simple matter of keeping track of one skin
name; I'll have to keep track of a list of name/resolution pairs.

The requests for fractions, equations, and decimal floating point keep cropping
up; I'm not committing to those features but I decided to put them back in the
TODO list so that people are aware that I am aware of these requests. :-)

Jeff O., 1/28/2005:
Basically, I would like to enhance the way complex numbers are entered,
displayed, and converted back and forth between rectangular and polar form. To
make entry more natural, I propose that a key labelled "i" be included on the
keyboard. This would be the label on the face of the key for the primary
function, not a shifted function. When entering a complex number in
rectangular form, one would merely key in the real part, then press "i" to
terminate entry of the real part and begin entering the imaginary part. When
done, you would press enter or any other operation as usual after keying in
any number. Both the real and imaginary parts of the number would be displayed
on one line in the display in the same way the 42S does it (NOT the way the
28, 48 and 49 display complex numbers). To key in a number in polar form, one
would not need to switch to polar display mode. Either there would be a
separate key, or the "i" key would have a shifted function, labelled with the
angle symbol. To enter a number in polar form, you would merely enter the
magnitude, then press the angle key (or shift "i"), then enter the angle. The
number would be displayed on one line in the display in polar form, again
exactly as the 42S does. Complex numbers in rectangular form and complex
numbers in polar form would be allowed to exist in the stack and/or any memory
registers at the same time. You could key in a rectangular form number, press
enter, key in a polar form number, press multiply, divide, etc. and get your
answer immediately with no worry about being in polar display mode or
rectangular display mode. The answer would by default be displayed in the
format of the number in the X register. As I see things, there would be no
real need for "polar" or "rectangular" display modes. There should be keys
with rectangular to polar and polar to rectangular conversion functions.
(Please label them as ->R and ->P, not the ->phi,r and ->y,x labelling of the
33S.) These keys would function as they do on the 42S. If the displayed number
is complex and displayed in polar form and you press the ->R key, it takes the
two components, treats them as magnitude and angle and converts and displays
them in rectangular form. If the displayed number is complex and displayed in
rectangular form and you press the ->P key, it takes the two components,
treats them as real and imaginary components and converts and displays them in
polar form. (If you try to convert a polar form number to polar form or
convert a rectangular form number to rectangular form, nothing would happen.)
If the X-register contains a real number, it takes the numbers in the X and Y
registers and converts and displays them accordingly. In a complex functions
menu, there would be a global command to convert all numbers currently stored
in the calculator to either polar or rectangular display. In this case, it
would not alter numbers already in rectangular form when converting all to
rectangular, and would not alter numbers already in polar form when converting
to polar.

One thing I thought would be great for Free42 is the ability to load 41 modules
in .MOD or .ROM format; not the machine-code stuff that is irrelevant to
the 42 (CCD, Advantage, Hepax, AEC, PPC...), but the PURE RPN modules, such
as Financial, Securites, Aviation, etc. For ease of use, this would require
maybe to expand the 42 to support directories and associated commands (MKDIR,
RMDIR, UPDIR,...) which is also good to organize stuff in an already much
improved 42 with I/O and loads of memory...
Today if you want to load 41 modules programs, you need to go into a painful
process using a 41 emulator: for each program you want, copy it into the
main memory, export it in raw format, and load the .raw in Free42. Not really
effective when you have tons of programs in a module.

GTK version.
