BCD floating point, possibly even as the default option. It turns out that
there are programs out there that rely on exact decimal math in order to pack
multiple numbers into one, similar to the BBBBB.EEESS of DSE/ISG etc.;
especially for people who use third-party code, there's no getting around the
need for BCD to make such legacy code work correctly (at least, without users
having to go through the code, looking for BCDisms, and fixing them manually).
The "IP Hack" option in the Free42 Preferences is meant to address this very
issue, but for many programs, it does not help. True BCD is the only reliable
way. The OpenRPN project has an open-source BCD library that may be worth a
look; other possible sources include http://www2.hursley.ibm.com/decimal/.
